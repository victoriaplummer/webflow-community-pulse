Hey y'all :wave::skin-tone-5:!

*TL;DR:* Cleaning up r/webflow with 3 weekly megathreads to reduce clutter and boost discussions.

*📅 New Weekly Threads*

*Monday* - Hiring Thread (job posts & "looking for dev" posts)
*Friday* - Feedback Friday (project critiques & portfolio reviews)
*Sunday* - Self Promotion Sunday (services, tools, templates)

*🎯 Why?*

Based on analysis of 994 posts:
• *15% are clutter* (feedback requests, hiring, self-promo)
• Consolidating these → *cleaner feed* + *better engagement*
• High-value content (tutorials, showcases, discussions) stays visible

*🛠️ How It Works*

Three tools working together:

1. *<https://www.reddit.com/mod/webflow/scheduledposts|Post Scheduler>* - Auto-posts weekly threads (drafts ready!)
2. *<https://www.reddit.com/mod/webflow/wiki/config/automoderator|AutoModerator>* - Auto-removes + redirects to weekly threads
3. *<https://www.reddit.com/mod/webflow/automations?tab=post-guidance|Automations>* - Shows guidance when users post

*✅ Next Steps*

- [ ] Review scheduled post drafts
- [ ] Add AutoMod rules (config ready to paste)
- [ ] Launch next Monday with announcement post

*Questions?* Full implementation guide available if needed.
