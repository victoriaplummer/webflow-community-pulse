# 📢 New Weekly Megathreads - Feedback Friday, Hiring Monday, Self Promotion Sunday

Hey r/webflow!

We're introducing **three new weekly megathreads** to help organize the subreddit and make it easier to discover high-quality discussions, tutorials, and showcases.

---

## 📅 The New Weekly Schedule

Post here if you want:
- Feedback on your website or design
- Portfolio review

### 🎉 Sunday - Self Promotion Sunday

Post here if you're sharing:
- Your Webflow app, plugin, or tool

## 🎯 Why the Change?

After analyzing the subreddit, we found that:
- **~15% of posts** are feedback requests, hiring posts, or self-promotion
- These posts often get lost in the feed
- Consolidating them helps **everyone get better responses**
- It keeps the main feed focused on **tutorials, showcases, discussions, and resources**

**This means more visibility for:**
- High-quality tutorials and educational content
- Completed project showcases
- Technical discussions and problem-solving
- Community resources and tools

---

## ✅ What's Still Allowed Anytime?

**You can still post these as standalone posts any day:**
- ✨ **Showcases** - Completed projects you've built (not asking for feedback)
- 📚 **Tutorials** - Step-by-step guides and educational content
- 🎬 **Quality YouTube videos/blogs** - Educational content with clear value
- ❓ **Questions** - Technical help, "how do I..." posts
- 💬 **Discussions** - Community topics, best practices, trends
- 🆓 **Free resources** - Genuinely free tools, components, templates

## 🤖 How AutoMod Will Help

Starting Monday, AutoModerator will:
1. **Gently redirect posts** to the appropriate weekly thread
2. **Leave a helpful comment** explaining where to post
3. **Keep the main feed clean** for high-value content

If your post gets redirected, **don't worry!** Just:
1. Find the pinned weekly thread for that day
2. Post your content as a comment in that thread

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I still share my YouTube tutorial on a Wednesday?**
A: Yes! Educational content is always welcome as standalone posts. Just make sure your title is descriptive and includes a summary.

**Q: What if I have a completed showcase, not a feedback request?**
A: Post it anytime! Just focus on what you built rather than asking for opinions. Use titles like "Built a X using Y" instead of "Thoughts on my site?"

**Q: What if my post gets removed by mistake?**
A: Reply to the AutoMod comment or message the mods. We'll review it and approve if it fits the exceptions.

**Q: Will this hurt engagement on my posts?**
A: Actually, the opposite! Weekly threads concentrate attention, so your post gets seen by everyone checking that thread. Plus, the main feed stays cleaner for everyone.
