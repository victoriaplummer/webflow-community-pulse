# AutoMod Removal Examples

Here's how the AutoMod removals will appear to users when their posts are redirected.

---

## Example 1: Feedback Request on Tuesday

**User's Post Title:** "Thoughts on my new portfolio site?"

**AutoMod Comment:**
```
Hi u/john_designer,

Thank you for sharing your work! We've removed this post because **feedback requests should be posted in our weekly Feedback Friday megathread** to keep the subreddit organized and ensure you get quality responses.

**Where to post:** Look for this week's "Feedback Friday" thread (pinned every Friday) and share your project there with:
- A link to your site
- Specific areas you want feedback on
- Any context about the project goals

**Exception:** If this is a completed showcase (not requesting feedback), please repost with a title like "Showcase: [Project Description]" and focus on what you built rather than asking for opinions.

Thanks for understanding!
```

## Example 2: Hiring Post on Wednesday

**User's Post Title:** "Looking for Webflow developer for e-commerce project"

**AutoMod Comment:**
```
Hi u/startup_founder,

We've removed this post because **job postings and hiring requests belong in our weekly Self Promotion Sunday megathread** to keep the subreddit organized.

**Where to post:** Look for this week's "Self Promotion Sunday" thread (pinned every Sunday) and share your opportunity there.

**Alternative:** For serious job postings, consider r/forhire or r/webflowjobs (if available).

Thanks for understanding!
```

## Example 3: Service Offering on Monday

**User's Post Title:** "Webflow expert available for design, development & issue fixing"

**AutoMod Comment:**
```
Hi u/freelance_dev,

We've removed this post because **service offerings and freelance advertisements belong in our weekly Self Promotion Sunday megathread**.

**Where to post:** Look for this week's "Self Promotion Sunday" thread (pinned every Sunday).

**Alternative:** Consider r/forhire or r/slavelabour for freelance work.

Thanks for understanding!
```

## Example 4: Template Sale Post

**User's Post Title:** "🔥 90% OFF - 50+ Premium Webflow Templates"

**AutoMod Comment:**
```
Hi u/template_seller,

We've removed this post because **sales and promotional offers belong in our weekly Self Promotion Sunday megathread**.

**Where to post:** Look for this week's "Self Promotion Sunday" thread (pinned every Sunday).

**Exception:** If you're sharing a genuinely free resource with no strings attached, please repost with a clear title indicating it's free and use the "Resource" flair.

Thanks for understanding!
```

## Example 5: Tool Launch from New Account

**User's Post Title:** "I built an AI SEO tool for Webflow - check it out!"

**AutoMod Comment:**
```
Hi u/new_developer,

We've removed this post because **product launches and tool promotions belong in our weekly Self Promotion Sunday megathread**, especially for newer accounts.

**Where to post:** Look for this week's "Self Promotion Sunday" thread (pinned every Sunday).

**Exception:** If this is a detailed tutorial or technical deep-dive (not just promoting your tool), please repost with a focus on the educational content and use the "Tutorial" flair.

Thanks for understanding!
```

## Example 6: Spam (Always Removed)

**User's Post Title:** "🔥 90% OFF Perplexity AI PRO – 1 Year Access!"

**AutoMod Action:** Removed as SPAM (no comment, just removed)

---

## Example 7: Account Selling (Always Removed)

**User's Post Title:** "Webflow account with $124 balance for sale - $99"

**AutoMod Comment:**
```
Selling Webflow accounts violates Webflow's Terms of Service and is not allowed on this subreddit.
```

## False Positive Examples (What WON'T Get Removed)

### ✅ Showcase with Context (Not Asking for Feedback)
**Title:** "Showcase: Rebuilt my portfolio after going full-time freelance"
**Body:** "Here's my new portfolio built entirely in Webflow. Used GSAP for animations and Finsweet for the CMS filtering. Happy to answer technical questions!"
**Result:** ✅ Allowed - This is sharing completed work, not requesting feedback

### ✅ High-Value Tool Launch (Educational)
**Title:** "Tutorial: How I built a Webflow app for SEO analysis - full walkthrough"
**Body:** Detailed post explaining architecture, code samples, challenges faced, with tutorial link
**Result:** ✅ Allowed - Substantial educational content, properly flaired

### ✅ Legitimate Question (Not Self-Promo)
**Title:** "Best approach for dynamic filtering with Webflow CMS?"
**Body:** Technical question about implementation
**Result:** ✅ Allowed - Genuine help request, not promoting anything

### ✅ Resource Share (Free, No Catch)
**Title:** "Free Webflow component library - 50+ pre-built elements"
**Body:** "I've been building Webflow sites for 5 years and compiled my most-used components. Everything is free to clone, no signup required."
**Result:** ✅ Allowed - Genuinely free resource giving back to community

## Tuning the Rules

After the first week, review:

1. **False Positives:** Legitimate posts getting removed
   - Add exceptions to AutoMod rules
   - Adjust keyword triggers

2. **False Negatives:** Spam getting through
   - Add more keyword patterns
   - Lower karma thresholds

3. **User Feedback:** Check modmail and comments
   - Are people confused about the rules?
   - Update removal messages for clarity

4. **Thread Engagement:** Are the weekly threads active?
   - If yes: Keep enforcing strictly
   - If no: Consider allowing more standalone posts temporarily

## Recommended Monitoring Schedule

**Week 1-2:** Check removed posts daily, manually approve false positives

**Week 3-4:** Check every other day, refine rules

**Week 5+:** Spot checks, trust the system

**Monthly Review:** Look at removal stats and adjust
