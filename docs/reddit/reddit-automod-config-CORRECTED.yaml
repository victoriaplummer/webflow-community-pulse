    Hi u/{{author}},

    Thank you for sharing your work! We've removed this post because **feedback requests should be posted in our weekly Feedback Friday megathread** to keep the subreddit organized and ensure you get quality responses.

    **Where to post:** Look for this week's "Feedback Friday" thread (pinned every Friday) and share your project there with:
    - A link to your site
    - Specific areas you want feedback on
    - Any context about the project goals

    **Exception:** If this is a completed showcase (not requesting feedback), please repost with a title like "Showcase: [Project Description]" and focus on what you built rather than asking for opinions.

    Thanks for understanding!
